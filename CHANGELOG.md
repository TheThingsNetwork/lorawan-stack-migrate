### Changed

### Deprecated

### Removed

### Security

## [v0.9.0] (2023-10-18)

### Added

- `tts` source to migrate devices between TTS instances.
- `--tts.no-session` and `--tts.delete-source-device` flags.
- Each source has its own dedicated command.
- End Device Claim Authentication Codes are exported only if `--export-cacs` is set.

### Changed

- `ttnv3` source is named `tts` now.

### Deprecated

- `--source` flag is now deprecated.

### Fixed

- `app-id` flag/variable is no longer needed when calling `application` command with `ttnv2` and `tts` sources.
- `application` command no longer panics when called with a different `app-id` argument than set with flag/variable.
- Using `--tts.no-session` flag will no longer crash.
- End Device Identifiers are now exported from all available servers.
- Wrong flag name `appplication-server-grpc-address` fixed to `application-server-grpc-address`.
- `--tts.no-session` no longer keeps the end device device address.

## [v0.8.1] (2021-10-12)

### Added

- Apple Silicon builds.

## [v0.8.0] (2021-10-12)

### Added

- `--set-eui-as-id` flag to re-map the ID of end devices. Using this flag will set the device ID to the DevEUI (if it has a DevEUI). When combined with the `--dev-id-prefix` flag, the ID will consist of the prefix and the DevEUI.

## [v0.7.0] (2021-09-27)

### Added

- Support optional prefixes to device IDs.

## [v0.6.0] (2021-06-08)

### Added

- `--ttnv2.resets-to-frequency-plan` flag for configuring factory preset frequencies when exporting ABP devices from The Things Network Stack V2. The list of frequencies is inferred from the chosen Frequency Plan.

### Changed

- Upgrade The Things Stack API to version `3.13.0`.
- Upgrade to Go version `1.16`.

### Fixed

- Properly handle files with Windows-style line endings ("\r\n").

## [v0.5.0] (2021-04-13)

### Changed

- Upgrade The Things Stack API to version `3.12.0`. Due to breaking API changes with The Things Stack 3.12, importing devices that were exported with `ttn-lw-migrate` will fail with previous versions of The Things Stack.

### Removed

- Docker images are no longer built for releases.

## [v0.4.0] (2021-03-26)

### Changed

- Rate limit RPC calls to TTN v2 to a maximum of 5 calls per second, to respect global TTN v2 rate limits.
- Disable `DevStatusReq` MAC command for devices exported from TTN v2.

### Fixed

- Retry when receiving errors of type ResourceExhausted and Unavailable, with a backoff.
